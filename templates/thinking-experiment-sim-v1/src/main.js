# Thinking Experiment Simulation Template (v1)

Use this folder as the starting point for new simulations to keep a consistent visual language.

## Includes

- Dark layered background + gold action accents
- Hero and panel shell layout
- Responsive desktop/mobile defaults
- Favicon links aligned to The Thinking Experiment

## Start new simulation

1. Copy this folder to a new repo/project.
2. Rename title and controls in `index.html`.
3. Build simulation logic in `src/main.js`.
4. Keep token and component naming from `styles.css` unless an explicit override is requested.
